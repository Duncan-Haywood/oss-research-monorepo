# Twin transfer: what a digital twin is worth for training a controller

Pure Python, no dependencies. Scalar linear-quadratic plant `x' = a x + b u + w`; a controller is trained in a digital twin `(â, b̂)` and deployed on the plant. Exact results in a worked scalar example, most of them textbook (the cost formula is an AR(1) stationary variance, the cliff is a gain margin, the blind spot is closed-loop identifiability; references in the paper): the deployment cost `σ²(q+rk²)/(1−c²)`, `c = a−bk`, and the regret of the twin-trained gain (asymmetric, with a stability cliff at `b̂/b ≈ 0.21` where regret is infinite); a **validation blind spot** — the twin's one-step log-score gap is `[Δa²Ex² + 2ΔaΔb·Exu + Δb²Eu²]/(2σ²)`, zero for a passive log however wrong `b̂` is, and zero on the deployed policy itself along `Δa = kΔb` — so predictive fit does not certify control without probing; and the **worth of a twin in real transitions**: a twin with bias δ used as a ridge prior with the oracle weight `σ²/δ²` is worth exactly `σ²/(vδ²)` real probe steps at every accuracy target, and rescues small-sample divergence; this needs δ, which is unknown in practice, so it is the value of a twin whose error is known. Matched to simulation within 1–4%. See `paper/whitepaper.md`.
