"""Verifier agent models and synthetic training-step tasks.

Models the setting from Gensyn's Verde ("a verification system for machine
learning over untrusted nodes") and Credibly Neutral AI Oracles: a stream of
training steps, each of which was either computed correctly or is faulty /
fraudulent, and a population of verifiers who each get a noisy private
signal about correctness and must report it. Ground-truth recomputation
(the "referee" in Verde, the audited report layer in Credibly Neutral AI
Oracles) is expensive and only applied to a small audited subset; peer
prediction is used to price the other reports.

@dataclass
class Verifier:
    """A verifier agent with a fixed reporting strategy.

    Strategies:
        honest: observes a noisy private signal of ground truth and reports
            it truthfully.
        lazy: skips verification (no signal cost) and always reports the
            modal outcome ("correct"), free-riding on other verifiers.
        colluding: a coordinated block that always reports a fixed value
            ("correct") regardless of the true signal, attempting to
            whitewash faulty steps cheaply.
        adversarial: observes the true signal but reports its negation,
            actively trying to flip the aggregate verdict (e.g. to get a
            fraudulent training update accepted).
        sleeper: a mechanism-aware trust-farming adversary. Reports
            honestly for tasks before ``switch_task`` (so any trust weight
            bootstrapped from that early window looks honest), then always
            reports "correct" like a colluder. Targets the one-shot
            calibration window used by ``reputation.py``.
        intermittent: an on/off trust-farming adversary. Honest before
            ``switch_task``; afterwards, in every ``period``-task cycle it
            reports honestly for the first ``(1 - defect_fraction)`` of the
            cycle and always reports "correct" for the rest. Targets
            rolling trust: defection is spread thin and interleaved with
            honest play, so a decayed PTS average may stay above the trust
            threshold.
        whitewash: a stealth, PTS-aware adversary. Honest except that
            when its private signal says "faulty" it reports "correct" with
            probability ``whitewash_prob``. Faulty steps are the minority
            label, so this deviation touches few tasks and barely moves an
            averaged Peer Truth Serum score (and hence trust), yet it is
            exactly the deviation that lets fraudulent training steps
            through.
