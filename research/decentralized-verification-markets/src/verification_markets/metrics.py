"""Evaluation metrics for a SimulationResult.

Includes a loose, illustrative comparison with the eps * (1 - eps) curve
from Gensyn's "Credibly Neutral AI Oracles" (Monroe, 2026). There, eps is
the report layer's error rate Pr[report != truth], and eps * (1 - eps) is
the worst-case manipulation vulnerability of a token-weighted dispute layer
whose overturn threshold is set to 1 - eps. Here we measure the empirical
wrong-verdict rate of a plain majority vote as a function of the fraction
of non-honest verifiers -- a different mechanism and a different eps, so
the two curves are not a test of that result.
