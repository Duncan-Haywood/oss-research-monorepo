"""Evaluation metrics for a SimulationResult.

Includes an empirical analogue of the manipulation-vulnerability bound from
Gensyn's "Credibly Neutral AI Oracles" (Monroe & Andrade): that paper bounds
the probability a supermajority-dispute mechanism reaches the wrong verdict
by eps * (1 - eps), where eps is the fraction of misreporting participants.
Here we measure the empirical wrong-verdict rate of a majority-vote
aggregator as a function of the fraction of non-honest verifiers, for
comparison against that theoretical curve.
