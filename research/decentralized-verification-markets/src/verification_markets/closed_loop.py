"""Closed-loop (trust-observing) whitewash adversary vs. rolling minority trust.

README Follow-up 6 could only sweep a *static* lie rate, because in
``simulation.py`` reports are generated before any mechanism runs, so an
agent cannot see its own trust weight. Here the loop is closed: reports for
block ``k`` are generated *after* the mechanism has computed the weights it
will apply to block ``k`` (from blocks ``< k``, as in
``stealth.rolling_minority_trust_market``), and each adversary picks its
lie probability for the block from its own weight -- a white-box adversary,
which is the worst case for a defender whose weights are public on-chain.

Adversaries start from the honest reports of a ``late_whitewash`` population
built with ``whitewash_prob=0`` (their private signal is their honest
report); on "faulty" (0) signals they report "correct" with the block's lie
probability. Controllers:

- ``fixed``: constant lie probability (the static baseline).
- ``threshold``: lie always while weight >= ``high``, stop until weight has
  recovered to ``high`` once it falls below ``low`` (hysteresis: spend trust,
  then farm it back).
- ``proportional``: ``p = clip(gain * (w - w_min), 0, 1)``: lie more the more
  trust is banked, ease off as it drains.
