"""Reputation / trust weighting for peer-prediction mechanisms.

Motivated by two limitations flagged in this package's README as "natural
next steps":

1. This package's *simplified* Correlated Agreement variant (pooled delta
   matrix, no cross-task penalty term) is not collusion-resistant against
   a *simultaneously* deviating block, because it pays every reporter from
   one shared same-task-correlation estimate (see ``peer_prediction.py``'s
   module docstring and
   ``tests/test_simulation.py::test_ca_is_vulnerable_to_simultaneous_correlated_deviation``).
   The README names "per-agent-pair delta estimation ... or an explicit
   collusion-detection pass before scoring" as the fix.
2. The LMSR aggregator weights every trade equally regardless of the
   trader's track record; the README names down-weighting known-bad actors
   by their historical peer-prediction score as the natural extension.

This module bootstraps a per-verifier trust weight from Peer Truth Serum
payoffs measured on a *held-out calibration window* -- so estimating trust
and scoring on it later never touch the same reports, closing this
package's third README limitation (circular in-sample prior/delta
estimation) along the way -- then uses that trust weight to:

- down-weight low-trust reporter pairs out of the Correlated Agreement
  delta-matrix estimate (``trust_weighted_correlated_agreement_matrix``),
  and
- scale their LMSR trade size (``reputation_weighted_trade_size``),

so persistent free-riders and colluders are discovered from their own
calibration-window behavior and discounted automatically, rather than
needing to be labeled ahead of time. PTS, not CA, is used as the trust
signal, because this package's own simulation already found PTS robust to
simultaneous correlated deviation where CA is not -- bootstrapping CA's
robustness off of PTS's is the point.
