# From scoring-rule loss to decision regret: certificates for accept / audit / slash

*Working note, MIT licensed. Stylised; numerical experiments in pure Python, no claims about any deployed protocol.*

## Motivation
Earlier notes in this repo pay verifiers with proper scoring rules (`effort-elicitation`, `effort-contracts`, `quantized-reports`).
A protocol designer ultimately cares about a *decision*: accept a claimed training result, audit it, or slash the worker. This note asks the
question studied for surrogate losses (Bartlett–Jordan–McAuliffe; Frongillo–Waggoner on polyhedral surrogates and regret transfer) in the
verification setting: **if a verifier's excess score is s, how much decision cost can the protocol have lost?** and turns the answer into
a computable certificate.

## Model (`src/decision_regret_transfer/model.py`)
True fault probability η; verifier reports q; the protocol acts as if q were true. Costs: accept Aη, reject R(1−η), audit c. The Bayes
regions are accept on [0, c/A], audit on [c/A, 1−c/R], reject on [1−c/R, 1] (binary with threshold τ = R/(A+R) when audit is never optimal).
A strictly proper score has excess score D(η, q), the Bregman divergence of its potential: (η−q)² for Brier, KL(η‖q) for log.

**Calibration function.** δ(ε) = min{D(η,q) : decision regret at (η,q) ≥ ε}. Because acting on q is optimal iff q is in the region,
the inner minimum is D(η, clip(η, region)), and the outer one is found by bisection on the convex piecewise-linear regret. So the transfer
is *exact*, not a bound, and is attained by a two-point verifier. Averages transfer through the lower convex envelope ψ of δ (Jensen):
**E[regret] ≤ ψ⁻¹(E[excess score])**, a certificate computable from a validation score alone.

## Results (`experiments/results.txt`)
**R1 (closed forms).** Binary, regret |η−τ| (A+R=1): Brier gives δ(ε)=ε², log gives δ(ε)=KL(τ+ε‖τ) (matches the code to 9 digits; at τ=½ this is ≈2ε²,
at small τ ≈ε²/(2τ(1−τ)) but KL is smaller than this quadratic for larger ε: at τ=0.02, ε=0.05 it is 0.039 vs 0.064, E1). Exact δ agrees with a 1500² brute-force grid
to within grid error (test).

**R2 (rare faults change the log-score transfer).** At a fixed excess of 0.01 nats the log-score decision-regret certificate falls from 0.071 at A/R=1 to
0.023 at A/R=50 and 0.013 at A/R=200 (E2), roughly √(2τ(1−τ)s) but 10–30% above it at small τ. The Brier certificate is √s = 0.1 regardless of τ.
These are different units (nats vs squared error), so this compares each rule's own guarantee, not the rules.

**R3 (polyhedral surrogates transfer linearly).** For the cost-weighted hinge (ℓ(f,fault)=(1−τ)(1−f)₊, ℓ(f,ok)=τ(1+f)₊) excess risk ≥ decision regret on the wrong side, with
ratio →1 (E3, all τ), i.e. δ(ε)=ε against ε² for Brier. But hinge scores are not strictly proper, so they do not elicit a probability that can be paid for or audited-priced;
in this stylised model the price of an incentive-compatible probability report is a square-root loss of guarantee (ε ≤ √s), not a free lunch either way.

**R4 (an audit action tightens the certificate).** Adding an audit band at A=R=1 raises the Brier δ(0.1) from 0.0025 to 0.0100 and the log δ(0.1) from 0.0050 to
0.0204–0.0444 depending on c (E4). A given decision regret then needs *more* excess score, so the same measured score certifies a smaller worst-case loss: the audit option
hedges near-threshold errors, and only a miscalibration large enough to jump a whole band costs the full accept/reject regret.

**R5 (certificates hold, and are loose on realistic verifiers).** With η∼Beta(2,5) and five miscalibration modes, realised regret is 8–26% of the certificate for both rules (E5) and
never exceeds it (also unit-tested). The certificate is exactly attained by a point-mass verifier at the tight pair (E6: 0.012235 = δ(0.05) at τ=0.1). So the bound is a worst-case guarantee, not a forecast.

## Implications
1. A validation score converts to an auditable cap on excess decision cost: compute ψ from (A, R, c), read off ψ⁻¹(measured excess score). Use it to set score-quality SLAs for verifiers.
2. Under log score, the more lopsided the costs (rare, expensive faults) the smaller the regret a given nat-gap can hide, so log score is preferable when fault cost ≫ slashing cost.
3. Optimising a smooth proper score gives ε² transfer; if only the decision is needed, polyhedral surrogates give linear transfer but cannot be paid as probability reports.
4. Combine with `effort-contracts`: the scale on the scoring rule sets both incentive strength and, through this note, the decision loss per unit of effort shortfall.

## Limits
Binary fault variable, known costs, a verifier report that is directly acted on (no aggregation across verifiers; see `expert-pooling`, `market-routing`), average-case certificate through
a grid-based convex envelope (resolution 1/400 of the regret range, accurate up to grid error), no strategic behaviour by the verifier beyond what the proper score already induces, and
the hinge comparison covers the binary case only (multiclass polyhedral surrogates need more dimensions; Frongillo–Waggoner).
